# kafka-insight-poc
A proof-of-concept integrating Apache Kafka with Azure OpenAI to enable conversational management of Kafka clusters. Instead of CLI commands, users ask natural language questions, and the AI generates and executes Kafka operations. Demonstrates how AI can simplify infrastructure operations and support the future of AI-driven AIOps.
